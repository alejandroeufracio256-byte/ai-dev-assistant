        Construct a new Carpet object

        The data describing carpet axis layout is set in `y` and
        (optionally) also `x`. If only `y` is present, `x` the plot is
        interpreted as a cheater plot and is filled in using the `y`
        values. `x` and `y` may either be 2D arrays matching with each
        dimension matching that of `a` and `b`, or they may be 1D
        arrays with total length equal to that of `a` and `b`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        arg
            dict of properties compatible with this constructor or
            an instance of :class:`plotly.graph_objs.Carpet`
        a
            An array containing values of the first parameter value
        a0
            Alternate to `a`. Builds a linear space of a
            coordinates. Use with `da` where `a0` is the starting
            coordinate and `da` the step.
        aaxis
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.carpet.Aaxis` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        asrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `a`.
        b
            A two dimensional array of y coordinates at each carpet
            point.
        b0
            Alternate to `b`. Builds a linear space of a
            coordinates. Use with `db` where `b0` is the starting
            coordinate and `db` the step.
        baxis
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.carpet.Baxis` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        bsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `b`.
        carpet
            An identifier for this carpet, so that `scattercarpet`
            and `contourcarpet` traces can specify a carpet plot on
            which they lie
        cheaterslope
            The shift applied to each successive row of data in
            creating a cheater plot. Only used if `x` is been
            omitted.
        color
            Sets default for all colors associated with this axis
            all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid
            color is lightened by blending this with the plot
            background Individual pieces can override this.
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements
        customdatasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `customdata`.
        da
            Sets the a coordinate step. See `a0` for more info.
        db
            Sets the b coordinate step. See `b0` for more info.
        font
            The default font used for axis & tick labels on this
            carpet
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ids`.
        legend
            Sets the reference to a legend to show this trace in.
            References to these legends are "legend", "legend2",
            "legend3", etc. Settings for these legends are set in
            the layout, under `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`,
            etc.
        legendgrouptitle
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.carpet.Legendgrouptitle`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with "reversed" `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having
            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed
            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and
            layout.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the
            legend item and on hover.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.carpet.Stream` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            A two dimensional array of x coordinates at each carpet
            point. If omitted, the plot is a cheater plot and the
            xaxis is hidden by default.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            A two dimensional array of y coordinates at each carpet
            point.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.
        zorder
            Sets the layer on which this trace is displayed,
            relative to other SVG traces on the same subplot. SVG
            traces with higher `zorder` appear in front of those
            with lower `zorder`.

        alignmentgroup
            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
            matching axes to the same alignmentgroup. This controls
            whether bars compute their positional range dependently

        autobiny
            Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
            determined separately and `autobiny` is not needed.
            However, we accept `autobiny: true` or `false` and will
            update `ybins` accordingly before deleting `autobiny`
            from the trace.
        bingroup
            Set a group of histogram traces which will have
            compatible bin settings. Note that traces on the same
            subplot and with the same "orientation" under `barmode`
            "stack", "relative" and "group" are forced into the
            same bingroup, Using `bingroup`, traces under `barmode`
            "overlay" and on different axes (of the same axis type)
            can have compatible bin settings. Note that histogram
            and histogram2d* trace can share the same `bingroup`
        cliponaxis
            Determines whether the text nodes are clipped about the
            subplot axes. To show the text nodes above axis lines
            and tick labels, make sure to set `xaxis.layer` and
            `yaxis.layer` to *below traces*.
        constraintext

            instance or dict with compatible properties
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements

        error_y
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.ErrorY` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        histfunc
            Specifies the binning function used for this histogram
            trace. If "count", the histogram values are computed by
            counting the number of values lying inside each bin. If
            "sum", "avg", "min", "max", the histogram values are
            computed using the sum, the average, the minimum or the
            maximum of the values lying inside each bin
            respectively.
        histnorm
            Specifies the type of normalization used for this
            histogram trace. If "", the span of each bar
            corresponds to the number of occurrences (i.e. the
            number of data points lying inside the bins). If
            "percent" / "probability", the span of each bar
            corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences
            with respect to the total number of sample points
            (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1). If
            "density", the span of each bar corresponds to the
            number of occurrences in a bin divided by the size of
            the bin interval (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals
            the total number of sample points). If *probability
            density*, the area of each bar corresponds to the
            probability that an event will fall into the
            corresponding bin (here, the sum of all bin AREAS
            equals 1).
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.

            instance or dict with compatible properties
        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-

            are available. Finally, the template string has access
            to variable `binNumber` Anything contained in tag
            `<extra>` is displayed in the secondary box, for
            example `<extra>%{fullData.name}</extra>`. To hide the
            secondary box completely, use an empty tag
            `<extra></extra>`.

            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having
            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed
            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and
            layout.

            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Stream` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets hover text elements associated with each bar. If a
            single string, the same string appears over all bars.
            If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to
            the this trace's coordinates.
        textangle
            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the
            bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick
            labels vertically. With "auto" the texts may
            automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size
            in bars.
        textfont
            Sets the text font.
        textposition
            Specifies the location of the `text`. "inside"
            positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated
            and scaled if needed). "outside" positions `text`
            outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless
            there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text
            gets pushed inside. "auto" tries to position `text`
            inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar
            is stacked on this one the text is moved outside. If
            "none", no text appears.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available. Finally, the template string has access
            to variables `label` and `value`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Unselected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            Sets the sample data to be binned on the x axis.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xbins
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.XBins` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            Sets the sample data to be binned on the y axis.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ybins
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.YBins` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        yhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:

            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.
        zorder
            Sets the layer on which this trace is displayed,
            relative to other SVG traces on the same subplot. SVG
            traces with higher `zorder` appear in front of those
            with lower `zorder`.
